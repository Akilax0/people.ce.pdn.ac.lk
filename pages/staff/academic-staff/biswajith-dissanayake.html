<a><b><u> Biography</u></b></a>

<p>
I am a Computer Departmental Lecturer at the Engineering Faculty, University of Peradeniya.
My work is at the intersection of generative modeling, probabilistic programming, and deep learning, with an interest in applications of machine learning for scientific discovery. 
I have recently focused on Bayesian inference in large-scale simulators, implementing code for distributed training and inference at supercomputing scale. I am also involved in Post Graduate course curriculum Development work as member of the PG Technical Committee.
Previously I was a IT Specialist at IBM world trade corporation working with Telecommunication on probabilistic programming. Before my work in IBM, I was a Lecturer at Uva wellassa University and Peradeniya university CE Departments. In Russia I specialized in differentiable programming, and I worked on compositionality, higher-order functions, and nesting of forward and reverse differentiation.
